# Decentralized-PI-Control-of-four-tank-system

In this computer exercise we will investigate properties of multivariable systems. The application is a model of a four-tank-process. In particular we will consider pairings between different input and output signals and non-minimum phase dynamics. The pairings are analyzed using RGA and we will investigate their influence in decentralized PI control.
